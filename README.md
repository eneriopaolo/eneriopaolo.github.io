Applications of Concept Taught:
  - Majority of my HTML tags had unique ID. I did that to easily edit that particular element with CSS selectors.
    Most of the text in the website was made with the <p> tag for more flexibility. I tried to section the content
    of the site with as much <div> tags as possible. That made position elements a little easier.
  - I styled most of the content in my website with ID selectors since I want most elements to have unique styling.
    I did use class selectors for some of the elements that have common designs.
  - I used flexbox with wrap and flex-direction set to row in order for my website to be responsive. I used this to
    divide items in the My Interest, My Achievement, and Projects section.
  - I tried to have minimalistic design with a simple font. I used the Helvetica font for texts on my website. I've
    used dark colors for background since I prefer dark mode.
  - Since this is a personal website, most of the content is from myself. I've given a brief introduction of myself.
    I've included both academic and extracurricular achievements that I got in the My Achievements section.
  - I've used animations on the images in the My Interests section. I've used @keyframes to specify what I want to
    do with the images. I've made simple resizing and rotation of images with transform and scale.

I've learned a lot of things when doing this website, LT0, and M1M2. I've discovered that there is a lot to learn
and to experiment with CSS to make user-friendly website. I've also become more proficient in searching the internet
for resources since I have been introduced to where I can find useful information.

This was my first time using GitHub as a platform. It took a while for me to adjust using it. Since I have little
prior experience in web development, it slows down my pace on doing the required activities. There's are a lot of
things that can be done with CSS. This also made it hard for me to find specifically what I need in some cases.
The thing that I struggled the most in making my personal website was making it responsive and position the elements
correctly.

If I would improve my website in the future, I would certainly apply better design principles and add more content.
I would also try to integrate JavaScript on it in the future.
